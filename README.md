## Summary

Recently, I had to integrate BigQuery with Databricks to securely and efficiently consume a dataset.  
After some testing, I opted to use a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket and authenticate via a service account key (JSON).  
I documented the entire process here both as personal reference and to support others going through something similar.
